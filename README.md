# Dust — A Minimal Interpreted Language

> *"Write fast, think clean, build small."*

Dust is a small interpreted programming language written in Python. It's designed to be understandable, hackable, and expressive with minimal syntax and maximum readability. It's not here to change the world—just to help you learn how one might.

---

## 🚀 Why Dust?

Dust is a toy language built for:

- Learning how interpreters and parsers work
- Experimenting with language design
- Creating small, readable programs without boilerplate
- Exploring implementation tradeoffs

If you’ve ever wanted to build your own language, Dust is a great place to see what that looks like, stripped down to its bare essentials.

## ✨ Features

- Basic, easy-to-understand syntax
- Variables, functions, and conditionals
- While loops and scoping
- A working REPL with multiline support
- Simple interpreter backend in Python
- Easily extendable

## 🛠 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bluewraith04/dust.git
cd dust
pip install .
````

```bash
dust
```

Run a script file:

```bash
dust path/to/file.dust
```

## 📘 Language Overview

```dust
// Hello world
print("Hello, Dust!");

// Variables
let x = 10;
let y = x + 5;

// Functions
fn add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

print(add(3, 4));

// Conditionals
if x > 5 {
    print("x is large");
} else {
    print("x is small");
}

// Loops
i = 0;
while i < 5 {
    print(i);
    i = i + 1;
}
```
